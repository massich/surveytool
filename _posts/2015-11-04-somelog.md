I got sidetracked trying to understand and use [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and [KEA](http://www.nzdl.org/Kea/index.html). The former is a python library to create semantic topics in unsupervised manner. While the later is a library to extract keywords provided by the same people who created WEKA. 

Despite these tools have been created to simplify text analysis, I am getting sidetracked and they are not simplifying my problem. So I jumped back to core NLTK.
