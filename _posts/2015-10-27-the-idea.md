We work in the field of medical imaging, by applying machine learning techniques to extract valuable information from images. However, when doing our daily tacks we forget of machine learning altogether, which is a shame since ML tools can help us a great deal.

This project is nothing but a set of scripts that helped us to skim through a large body of scientific literature in order to built an overview of segmenting breast lesions in Ultra-Sound data.

To do so, these points need to be addressed:

- Technical issues:
  - How to gather the articles
  - How to manipulate the articles
    - convert them from PDF to text
    - Analyze the text

- Conceptual study issues:
  - A strategy to explore the literature
  - What are we looking for in this study?
    - Which terms shall we explore
