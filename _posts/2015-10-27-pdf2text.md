There are different manners to treat pdfs in python. It seems that the back-end of choice is [PDFMiner](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer). However there are several libraries that are built on top of PDFminer to easy the job.

## The choice A
I have decided to try first [slate](https://github.com/timClicks/slate) which is supposed to be a easy wrapper around **PDFMiner** focused only on the text part.

### Note
PyPI version of slate at date 27th October 2015 is slate-0.3, which has some issues with the name chaning done at PDFMiner at date 2013/11/13.

We used the github version

## The choice B
I've chosen to use (or explore) [PyPDF2](http://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/), which picked up where PyPDF package was left. There are several forks to the project, here are some useful links of the active project at date 27th of October 2015.

- [package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPDF2)
- [github repo](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2)
- [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/)

### Discarded projects
- [ pdf2text ](https://github.com/syllabs/pdf2text) its out of date, requires PDFMiner 20110515, it does not convert properly and messes a lot with the formulas and references.

- **PyPDF** it has been substituted by PyPDF2.

#### Using PDFMiner (alone)

Here is a [stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5725278/python-help-using-pdfminer-as-a-library) with its accompanying [MWE solution](https://gist.github.com/jmcarp/7105045) using PDFMiner.

#### PDF articles written in 2 columns
Based on this [other stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32471587/how-to-convert-double-column-pdf-to-word-using-python), recovering the text from a 2 column article might not be straight forward.

#### Recover words splited by a dash when line breaking
Based on our own experiments, those words are not properly recovered. They are just interpreted as two separated words (plus the sentence is broken).
