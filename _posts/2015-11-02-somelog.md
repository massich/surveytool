I had troubles with generating the keywords by simply applying libraries and
I decided to change a little bit my strategy. I started by manually converting
some PDF files to text that I would further use to generate the keywords.

Regarding how to generate the keywords I started looking into the following references:

  - https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-extract-keywords-from-a-document-using-NLTK
  - https://github.com/resbaz/nltk
  - https://github.com/sujitpal/nltk-examples

I guess that after looking at this material I would be able to manage myself to
do the task in hand. Otherwise, I pretend to look into the following
references:
