To perform a systematic survey, an initial set of journals is used to query for perticular keyworkds. Here is explained how this journals have been selected.


##Use Journal Citation Reports (JCR)
The Journal Citation Reports (JCR) every year publish the citations of the journals and categorizes them based in some criteria. There are two main categories related to the aim of this survey: Breast lesion segmentation methodologies. 

####Engineering, Biomedical
Engineering, Biomedical covers resources that apply engineering technology to solving medical problems. Resources in this category span a wide range of applications including applied biomechanics, biorheology, medical imaging, medical monitoring equipment, artificial organs, and implanted materials and devices.

####Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging
Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging covers resources on radiation research in biology and biophysics. Resources in this category focus on interventional radiology, investigative radiology, neuroradiology, radiotherapy, and oncology. Nuclear Medicine resources are concerned with the diagnostic, therapeutic, and investigative use of radionuclides. Medical Imaging resources are concerned with computerized medical imaging and graphics.

### Selection Criteria
The journals that appear in both categories
